### Project Description

The goal of this project is to implement a text-based board game. The game chosen by the group was 369. Its rules can be checked out [here](https://www.di.fc.ul.pt/%7Ejpn/gv/369.htm).

### Project Development State

The group didn’t correctly understand the rules of the “real” 369 game until this version was fully implemented and it was too late to completely change its logic. Even so, we believe the logic of the correct implementation wouldn’t have been much different then the one we arrived to and, if we consider the requirements that we based our implementation on, then all the goals for the project were reached. The report is available [here](./docs/report.pdf).
